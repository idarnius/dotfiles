# dotfiles
The point where I have configured a lot of generic settings, configurations and themes.
Usage

# Basic installation:

$ git clone git://github.com/idarnius/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ scripts/check # verifies if the system has the needed packages
$ scripts/install # symlinks config files and setup Vim plugins.
You can remove them with:

$ scripts/remove

# Vim

My Vim configuration file uses Vundle to manage the plugins.
